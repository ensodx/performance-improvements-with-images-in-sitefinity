### Summary
---
This repository hosts an example approach towards 80-90% page size and performance improvements using a different approach to render images in Sitefinity.

On a sample page, with 2 full-width and 3 smaller images the total page size is reduced from 5.1Mb to 457Kb transfered.

The sample page includes some _lorem ipsum_ as content filler to allow for the additional bonus feature of all images being lazy loaded.
